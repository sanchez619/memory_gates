            <h2 id="m-introduction">The true nature of Memory</h2>
                <p> Curious image, is it not? A figure cloaked in black, holding a katana and wearing a Inari mask. By the way, can you 
                remember the color of the gate? It is white, no? Can you see that swordsman with his robes in your mind?
                This is how the memory actually works. As US Memory Champ Joshua Foer says: "Memory is non-linear." The brain associates
                items via various factors, including spacial proximity, temporal proximity and more. Mking sense of the factors is called 
                Mnemonics â€“ The art of remembering. Various memory athletes have shown tremendous feats of memorization, and we use 
                these techniques to help you not forget.

                    <h3>The Story Gate</h3>
                    <p>Various stories and myths have stood the test of time. King Arthur, Heracles, Prince Siddharta... their tales were told
                    in a way which made it possible to remember information even without written media.
                    This phenomenon can be used to quickly remember many random things you require on a list. If you can let your mind
                    create a story containing everything you need to know, you can skip writing a shopping list for good.

                    <h3>The Number Gate</h3>
                    <p>Named after its creator, the Major Method is the most popular way to memorise numbers. You exchange number foe
                    consonants and create small words or phrases. This way, even number with larger digits can stay in your mind.
                    Do you see the number 4,617,521? What I see is a gate to the R(u)sh D(u)ck L(a)nd, a theme park made for duck races.
                    Seems silly? But does it still seem silly when you remember important statistics with this method?

                    <h3>The Palace Gate</h3>
                    <p>Around 500 years BC, the Greek philosopher Euripides achieved an astounding feat. In his mind, he was able to tell the
                    whereabouts of all people inside a collapsed building. This way, he was able to find the remains of every person for the
                    families to properly mourn and lay to rest.
                    It is the first mention of a mind palace. Spatial awareness is the most basic of human skills and this technique uses
                    this skill to link information with familiar locations. The mind palace can be used to store massive amounts of
                    information for almost indefinitely, like one of the greatest literary characters, Sherlock Holmes, has proven time and
                    time again.
