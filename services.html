            <h2>How can we help you?</h2>
            <p> Mnemonics are often a very daunting subject. The art of memory tells its users to let go of common logic and structure
            in order to open their actual remembering capabilities. This requirement has driven many people from learning these
            useful skills.
            We from Memory Gates want to help you have a good introduction into the art of memory. Our mission is to open pathways
            for your memory and create gates to help you find the way. Just like a fox in Japanese mythology, we want to guide you
            to places and views you have never seen before. </p>

                    <p>You are close to an important deadline, but you cannot get those pieces of information into your head? Whenever you need
                    someone to help you memorise something fast, we at Memory Gates offer assistance. Send in the data you need to memorise
                    via our “Build a Gate” webpage. Our team will create a Memory Gates sheet so that you will memorize that data in no
                    time. Be it a test at school, a presentation at a business conference or maybe the lines you say to your partner, Memory
                    Gates will help you etch whatever you need into your mind.</p>

                    <p>Memory needs creativity. The ability to combine seemingly random things is absolutely necessary to improve your brain.
                    “But I am not a creative person!” is what many people would say. However, creativity does not mean artistry. In
                    Japanese, the word for creativity is “souzouryoku”, the power to create/build. In a sense, creativity is productivity.
                    We at Memory Gates know how essential creativity is in the modern world, not just for memory, but for the modern market.
                    Via personal sessions, we can discover in which you can unleash your creative powers. Not only will this help you
                    improve your memory, but also realise hidden potentials you never realized you had.

                <h3>Mnemonics Training</h3>
                <p>As we at Memory Gates believe in the power of Mnemonic techniques, we strive to make these techniques accessible to
                everyone. However, our biggest wish is for you to use memory strategies on your own. The path to mastering Mnemonics is
                a long one, and no path will ever be the same. Nevertheless, we offer every client our services to find out their unique
                strengths and dispositions to effectively learn and apply the Mnemonic technique best suited for them. If you feel up to
                the challenge, our guidance into memory strategies can massively improve your own remembering capabilities to a point
                that not even modern psychology can scientifically explain.</p>
