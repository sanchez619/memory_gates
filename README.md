# Memory Gates

## A rundown for a B2C Mnenomic Training Website

### Intention

As an educator, my goal has always been to provide my students with the most thorough care and the best possible tools to tackle language learning goals easily and without unnecessary effort. This sentiment has led me to teach and practice Mnemonic techniques, learning strategies for memorization and non-linear thinking. Many famous memory competitors have displayed feats of memorzation which seemingly seem impossible from a contemporary view on human memory. Hence, it only seemed logical to pass on these techniques to my students. In interaction with teenagers from 11-15 years, I have accumulated a general awareness of the merits and issues in teaching memory strategies. This website "Memory Gates" serves as a first foundation to help other people via the use of Mnemonic strategies and eventually passing them on.

### Methods of Achieving goals

Memory Gates
*introduces the user an overview of Mnemonics and services on separate webpages.
*uses Japanese mythological images to create a memorable imagery that illustrate the nature of Mnemonics.
*provides a form, which allows the users to send their data to learn to Memory Gates.

In a more advanced version, Memory Gates...
*will send the user a cheatsheet using fitting Memory strategies to remember their data.
*contact customers to discuss their own way of conceptualising information.
*provide outlines for customers on how to use their way of thinking to improve their creative thinking.
*offer private sessions to teach Mnemonic strategies.

## **Planning Stages**

In an earlier build, the website was supposed to be called Memory Empire.
The website had a stronger focus on teaching Mnemonic techniques and was supposed to feature a medieval style.
My initial goal with Memory Empire was to:
*display the non-linear structure of human memory.
*inspire the user to order their memory.
*provide the Mnemonic strategies as aid for the user.

About halfway into designing the website, I abandoned the concept and decided to change the design and outline for Memory Empire.
This was done for the following reasons:
*The mental imagery of an Empire was not memorable in itself. Thus, it didn't reflect the message it was intended to portray.
*Instead of serving as an aid, the provider should play the role of a guide that can be followed in their traces.
*The user should have the option to acquire the benefits of Mnemonics without having to necessarily learn them.

Eventually, the focus shifted to a Japanese-styled imagery based on the Torii, Shintoist Temple Gates.
The benefits of these changes were:

## **General Elements**

### Header Element

The Header element is absolute and does always stays visible, even after scrolling downwards. This feature ensures that the user would always have access to all pages.

Title:
*The title represents the brand name and uses a different font from the rest of the header.
*It contains an a-element back to the index.html. This way, the main message of the website is always just one click away.

### Navigation Bar

Checkbox
*The checkbox is represented via the image of a Torii.
*It is position to the right of the screen, where you would find the burger icon on other webpages.
*The Torii enforces the visual imagery of the website, as the user would likely search for the menu in that area of the page.
*it disappears on larger devices in order not to distract from the hero image.

Navigation Bar:
Dropdown Menu (below 768px):
*The menu is kept simple - keeping the focus on the hero images.
*A click on the Torii gate will make it appear and disappear.
*The three menu items - 'Mnemonics', 'Services' and 'Build a Gate' - connect to the other informative or interactive webpages.
*The active webpage changes its color to a lighter red to indicate the user's location on the website.

Integrated Menu (769px+)
*The menu items are integrated into the header in order not to distract from the hero image.
*The position is kept on the right side of the page not to confuse the user.
*They remain the function to switch color when active.
*On laptops and larger screen sizes, the color also changes when the user hovers the mouse above the item.

Hero Images:
*The Hero images are the main focus of the webpages. They serve two functions:
  *create a consistent Japanese mythical imagery.
  *present fitting visual representations for the topic of each website.
*They fit the entire viewscreen when accessing the site and define the viewers first impression.
*The informative webpages all contain a cover text, which communicates the main intention of each webpage.

### Footer

*The footer contains the icons for the most common social media websites.
*They will/would then connect the user to the social media webpages of Memory Gates.
*Nothing else was added. Any other information or text would distract the user from processing the information and the imagery on the webpages.

Fonts:
*In order to enhance the artistry of the images, I decided to use two additional fonts which would add an "elegant" feeling, based on my perception.
*For the headlines, the font "Taviraj" is used.
*All other text appears in the font "Raleway."
*Both fonts can be found on Google Font.

## **Individual Page Features**

### index.html

Hero image:
[!Torii Hero Image]("assets/images/torii_1920.jpg")

* The image display a boy standing on a shallow lake. The ground is plastered with photos and the background shows a Torii Gate illuminated by the dusk.
* The image is supposed to represent the user (boy), the memories (photos) and the service of Memory Gates (Torii Gates).
* The cover text conveys a call to action and the benefit of doing so.

Content:

* The paragraph illustrates the function and the surrounding atmosphere of Torii Gates.
* The distinct and different appearances of Torii link into the service offer from Memory Gates.
* The user is given a possible end goal to learn memory strategies themselves.

### about.html

Hero image:
[!Ronin Hero Image]("assets/images/ronin_1920.jpg")

* A person with a fox mask and a katana stands in front of a white Torii gate.
* The unusual combination of clothes and items makes the person unique. This way, the importance of vivid and extraordinary imagery is represented.
* The cover text conveys the guiding function of Mnemonics and associates them with the image of a gate.

Content:

* The first content section introduces the user to the concepts of Mnemonics and non-linear memory.
* The hero image is used as example to illustrate the effect of imagery on memory.

* The second content section provides a quick rundown of three well-known Mnemonic Strategies.
* Each strategy is explained in a short paragrah.
* A supporting picture is positioned next to each paragraph.

### services.html

Hero image:
[!Fox Hero Image]("assets/images/fox_1920.jpg")

* The image displays a fox sitting in front of a Torii.
* The fox serves as representation of Memory Gates as a knowledgeable guide - a motif taken from Japanese mythology.
* The drawing style is less realistic in order not to seem intimidating to the user.
* The cover text is another call for action to the user, but it assures them the guidance and assistance from Memory Gates

Content:

* The first content section lays out the problem of accessibility regarding Mnemonics.
* At the same time, the user is assured that they can reap benefits from using Memory Gates, regardless of whether they want to learn Memory strategies or not.

* The second content section provides a quick rundown of three well-known Mnemonic Strategies.
* Each strategy is explained in a short paragrah.
* A supporting picture is positioned next to each paragraph.

### request.html

Hero image:
[!Mountain Hero Image]("assets/images/mountain_1920.jpg")

* The image displays a Torii next to a mountain. The light paints everything in a dark yellow shade.
* I chose this picture because it shows a high obstacle, but the Torii stands next to it to guide those who attempt to climb the mountain.

Form:

* The body is positioned inside of the hero image and contains a form.
* The form is transparent as not to lose the visual effect of the hero image.
* This form represents a request from the user to Memory Gates. Inside, they can fill in the necessary information to order a memory guide for a set of information of their choice.
* The first three pieces of information are the users first name, last name and Email Address. Each are assigned to a input function and the respective label.
* Then, the user is required to indicated the field of usage for their information / data.
* The following two text areas allow the user to specify the order.
  * First, the user can describe the nature of their information / request in more detail.
  * Afterwards, the user provides their fields of expertise and/or interest to Memory Gates. This information will help the provider create mental imagery which fits the individual user.
* Before submitting this form, the user has the option to add a file to their request. This information will be referenced if the user already has very specific information in mind. If no file is provided, Memory Gates will reach out with a concept for fitting mental associations and discuss the necessary information with the user.
* After filling in the form, the user can submit their request via the 'Build a Gate' button. This button will direct them to the 'confirmation.html' webpage.
* Should the form contain significant flaws, the user can reset their input via the button 'Begin Anew'.

### confirmation.html

* The hero image is the same file used in services.html
* The usage of the fox enforces the association between the fox and Memory Gates
* This page merely serves as confirmation for the user. They also are advised to return to the main webpage.

## Future Features

While the idea of using software or even AI to create mnemonics on the spot seems tempting, these changes would be far too advanced and would not likely result in memorable mnemonics.
The simpler, but more effective solution would be to create form for each specific mnemonic strategy.

* The Story Method could be enhanced via the use of a website with a dedicated textarea. On this page, the user could mark keywords they would like to remember.
* The Major Method would probably benefit from a table-like form, which assignes each number to a specific image or object. These items would be provided by the user.
* The Mind Palace would require a huge

Another sensible addition would be the collaboration with experts from the field of Mnemonics. Content creators like Anthony Metivier have carved out a niche for Memory strategies on the web and display regular activity. With his or other Memory experts' approval, Memory Gates would share their content in video or audio format.
For this change, a blog needs to be created, which contains updates, guest content to keep users informed about the Mnemonics community.

## **Testing**

* The testing was mainly done on the browsers Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge and Opera.
* The website was tested for a screen width between 280px and 1440px. Appropriate media queries apply to all ranges.
* The tests in the HTML and CSS Validator were passed without major incident. All webpages passed.
* While in earlier builds the

Bug fixing:
During the creation of the website, these following major issues appeared.

1. Flex-Box Styling

2. Flex-Box

3. Footer

One remaining bug could not be continuosly fixed:

* For mobile, the request.html form would expand beyond the screen width on a German system. The cause is the file-input, which indicates whether a file was submitted or not. Unfortunately, the default phrase "Keine Datei ausgewählt" could not be removed permanently. The result is that the webpage would adjust its center to the right.
* Solutions like hiding the input were rejected, as the indicator is necessary for the user.
* However, the bug seems dependent on the system. In tests with my mentor Richard Wells, the centre of the page does not move. Ultimately, the decision was made to document, but not remove the bug.

Testing with third parties:
During end phases of programming, I sent a link to close friends and co-workers. They checked the website (mostly on mobile) for any user issues, and pointed out minor design flaws (like color or positioning). In general, they reported no major issues.

## **Credits**

* The images used are free-use images from the website "Pixabay." The various users allowed the usage as long as the image itself was not used for sale.
* For various small programming details, the website "W3S-Schools" served as reference, especially regarding the style of frames as well as flexbox properties.
* While the knowledge about Japanese language and culture stems mainly from my exchange year at Kanazawa University, general information about Torii Gates and the Inari can be found on Wikipedia. (Both webpages references external sources extensively, so it is as reliable as an open source can get.)
* While the phrasing and explanation of the Mnemonic techniques were written by myself, Nelson Dellis' "Memory Superpowers!: An Adventurous Guide to Remembering What You Don't Want to Forget" and Joshua Foer's "Moonwalking with Einstein: The Art and Science of Remembering Everything" serve as basis for all content regarding memory strategies.

## **Special Thanks to**

* Richard Wells, my mentor who has had an open ear for all of my ideas and makes sure that I know exactly what I need to fix in my code.
* Anthony Metivier, for inspiring me to delve deeper into Mnemonics and showing me that memory is a skill, not a talent.
* all friends, family members and co-workers supporting me on my new career path.
